## Development

To work with the scss, we need to make sure to use the ruby gem `sass`. To install, run `gem install sass` from the terminal. Next, `cd` into the root project dir and run `./scss.sh`. This will turn on the sass compiler and watch `agent.scss` for any changes and automatically compile it to css.
